# Work in progress: 

I am currently working on adding multiplayer rooms where multiple users can play the same puzzle and whoever solves it faster gets a point. I'm using a redis in-memory database for temporary storage and websockets for bidirectional communication between the frontend and the backend.

A fully functional single player version is available at [cynicade.xyz/minesweeper](https://www.cynicade.xyz/minesweeper)
